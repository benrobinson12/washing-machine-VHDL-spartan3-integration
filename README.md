# washing-machine-VHDL-spartan3-integration

The aim of this project is to design the finite state machine for a washing machine using VHDL(VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and integrate it onto a spartan3a chip.
VHDL expanded is Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language.

The objective of this project is to:
Use LEDS to indicate the current stage of the cycle.
display time taken for each cycle on a 7 segment display.
convert the on-board 50MHz clock to a 1Hz clock so that each second is a single clock.

This code is used in xilinx software to synthesize and implement onto the spartan 3 development board.
